This project is made with simple python code and the Quizzes are based on the Indian Cricketer ROHIT SHARMA.
I used the shuffle method {random.shuffle(quiz_data)}  which ask random quizzes at a time and automatically it will shuffle itself.
It will show your score in the end and shows which one is the correct answer if your answer is wrong.
